# What is Hearkus?

Hearkus is a free and open-source platform for discovering and sharing feedback
on music. We scour the internet to bring you the freshest and most exciting new
artists, and give you the chance to rate and review the music you hear. Whether
you're a seasoned music critic or just looking to expand your listening
horizons, our site is the perfect place to find your new favorite tunes.

Hearkus works by feeding an algorithm a list of artists and songs that you like,
and using feedback from you and other users with similar tastes to recommend
similar content. The more you use the site, the better it becomes at
recommending music you will love.

We also plan to have a browser extension that streams data from your favorite
music streaming service to your Hearkus profile, so you can feed your private
listening habits to the algorithm without using two separate services manually.
